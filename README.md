# CarCrash
1-D interactive car crash simulation

This program was written in Python 3.2.2 using the graphics module VPython. VPython can be installed using the following links:

Windows: http://vpython.org/contents/download_windows.html

Mac: http://vpython.org/contents/download_mac.html


Upon launching the program, you will see the scene in one window and the shell prompting you for a response in another. Once you have responded to all of the inquiries in the shell window, the simulation will begin. Once the simulation is complete, you will see a report of how accurate your guesses were in the shell window.
